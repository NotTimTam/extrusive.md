Get started by editing this file or creating your own folder structure within the "content" directory!

You can run `npx extrusive build` to build your app, or `npx extrusive start` to start your development server.

Remember, the "README.md" file in the root of the content directory is a special homepage document!

```js
console.log("Happy hacking!");
```
